When you create or update a table, you specify how much provisioned throughput capacity you need for reads and writes. DynamoDB will allocate the necessary machine resources to meet your throughput needs while ensuring consistent, low-latency performance.

A unit of read capacity represents one strongly consistent read per second (or two eventually consistent reads per second) for items as large as 4 KB. A unit of write capacity represents one write per second for items as large as 1 KB.
